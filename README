gedit2 plugins
==============

This is a collection of plugins for gedit 2, some of which were
originally hosted at [1] (since dead) and listed at [2]. These will not
work with gedit 3, but can be freely ported by anyone wanting to do so.
Some of these might already be ported [3] and/or superseded by something
better.
